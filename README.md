# ProiectTM-SQL

## Introduction:
We will be creating a database for storing and retrieving information about PC builds including all the parts from these builds.
Types of data query used:
DDL or Data Definition Language that consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
